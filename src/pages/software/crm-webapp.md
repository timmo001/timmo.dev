I have been experimenting a CRM webapp. It allows you to manage your customers and their orders. It is built using [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It's very rudimentary, but it works well and has the potential to be extended into whatever kind of CRM system you need.

The whole webapp is using server side rendering, using the Next.js app router. Any changes are autosaved after a timeout.

Take a look at the screenshots below to see what it looks like.

> The app is currently in a private GitHub repository, but I plan to open source it at some point.
