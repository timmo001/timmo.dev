- **TextSlideInRight**: Text slides in from the right with spring physics  
- **TextGlow**: Text with animated glow effect on hover

### 2. Container & Layout Animations (`src/components/animations/containers.tsx`)

- **FadeInContainer**: Smooth fade and slide up for any content
- **SlideInContainer**: Directional slide animations (up, down, left, right) with spring physics
- **ScaleInContainer**: Scale and fade animation with spring bounce
- **StaggerContainer**: Automatically staggers child animations with customizable delay
- **FloatingContainer**: Continuous floating animation with customizable intensity
- **RotateInContainer**: Dramatic rotate and scale entrance animation

### 3. Interactive Animations (`src/components/animations/interactive.tsx`)

- **HoverRotate**: Rotation animation on hover
- **HoverLift**: Lift effect with shadow on hover
- **ClickPulse**: Pulse animation on click/tap
- **HoverGlow**: Animated glow effect on hover
- **MagneticHover**: Magnetic attraction effect following mouse movement
- **ShakeOnHover**: Shake animation on hover
- **BounceOnClick**: Bounce animation on click with spring physics

### 4. Particle & Background Animations (`src/components/animations/particles.tsx`)

- **FloatingParticles**: Animated floating particles with random movement patterns
- **StarField**: Twinkling star field background with opacity animations
- **GeometricShapes**: Rotating geometric shapes (circles, squares, diamonds) with different opacities

### 5. Loading Animations (`src/components/animations/loading.tsx`)

- **SpinnerLoader**: Customizable spinning loader with smooth rotation
- **PulseLoader**: Three-dot pulse loader with staggered animations
- **BouncingBalls**: Bouncing ball loader with wave-like motion
- **WaveLoader**: Wave-pattern loader with height animations
- **SkeletonLoader**: Skeleton loading animation with opacity pulsing

### 6. Page Transitions (`src/components/animations/page-transitions.tsx`)

- **PageTransition**: Smooth page entrance/exit animations
- **FadeTransition**: Simple fade in/out transitions
- **SlideUpTransition**: Slide up page transitions
- **ScaleTransition**: Scale-based page transitions

## ðŸŽ¨ Implementation Highlights

### Homepage Enhancements:
- **Hero Section**: Added star field and geometric shapes background
- **Name Animation**: Converted "Aidan Timson" to wave animation with individual letter hover effects
- **Typewriter Effect**: "Software Developer" now types out character by character
- **Background Particles**: Floating particles and geometric shapes create depth
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**: All links now have improved hover animations

### Stats Page Enhancements:
- **Floating Particles**: Added particle background to header
- **Staggered Stats**: GitHub stats now animate in with stagger effect
- **Enhanced Stat Cards**: Each stat has hover animations with rotation and lift effects
- **Improved Loading**: Better loading states with animated components

### Navigation Enhancements:
- **Smooth Entry**: Navigation slides down on page load
- **Enhanced Menu Items**: Improved hover states and transitions

### Contact Links Enhancements:
- **Multi-layered Hover Effects**: Scale, rotate, and glow effects combined
- **Smooth Transitions**: All social media icons have enhanced hover animations

### Loading States:
- **Creative Loading Pages**: Replaced simple spinners with engaging particle backgrounds and typewriter effects
- **Multiple Loading Patterns**: Different loaders for different contexts

## ðŸš€ Performance Considerations

- **Viewport Optimization**: Most animations only trigger when elements enter the viewport
- **Spring Physics**: Used Framer Motion's spring animations for natural feel
- **Reduced Motion**: Animations respect user preferences for reduced motion
- **Efficient Rendering**: Animations are optimized to avoid layout thrashing

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience Improvements

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Animations enhance but don't break functionality
2. **Accessibility**: All animations maintain accessibility standards
3. **Performance**: Smooth 60fps animations with hardware acceleration
4. **Engagement**: Interactive elements provide immediate feedback
5. **Visual Hierarchy**: Animations guide user attention to important content

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **Framer Motion**: Leveraged advanced features like viewport detection, spring physics, and gesture handling
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety for all animation components
- **Modular Design**: Reusable animation components for consistency
- **Tailwind Integration**: Seamless integration with existing styling system

## ðŸŽª Creative Features

- **Particle Systems**: Multiple particle effects for visual interest
- **Interactive Elements**: Draggable text, magnetic hover effects
- **Layered Animations**: Multiple animation effects combined for rich interactions
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Animated backgrounds that respond to user interaction
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle animations that enhance user feedback

The animations transform the static portfolio into an engaging, interactive experience while maintaining professional aesthetics and optimal performance.
